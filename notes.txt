Thoughts on next steps.


DONE 1. Get the relays mounted, wired, and hooked up to the real
   circuits.
DONE 2. Backup the old sprinkler image and create a fresh one with docker and the app
3. Set up cron job to run the simple script to start watering


DONE 4. Add prometheus metrics to the server
5. Add two metrics
    - a simple bool that says if we're actively watering
    - a gauge that shows active rainfall
DONE 6. Start prometheus scraping them - maybe every 30s?
7. have a very long timeframe and see how prometheus does
    - federation and downsampling maybe?
8. Create app for rain gauge that sends data to update the sprinkler accumulation counters


1. Start building external Driver app to decide when to water
2. Each circuit would have a target water goal, possibly based on temp too
3. app would periodically look at prometheus and decide which circuits need watering
